#### Make changes in a codespace

Code spaces are pretty cool so if you have access, try out making changes in a code space.

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the application, [check to see if an issue exists already](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If none exists, create a new issue and request to solve it.

#### Solve an issue

Look through [existing issues](https://github.com/Fortune-Adekogbe/Toyota-Models-Classification/issues) to identify one that you are interested in. Request to be assigned the issue and when you are, solve it.

### Commit your update

Commit the changes you have made once you have tested it and think it is good to go.

### Pull request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
Once your PR is made:
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### The finish line: Your PR is merged!

Congratulations :tada::tada:, we appreciate you.
